This includes the most populr movies and TV shows with detail pages, a search box for movies and shows with full pagination and a slider for movies that are currently playing in theaters. The slider uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) library.

## Starter Files

The starter files is located in the folder starterfiles. All the html and other relevant files is located there for you to be able to solve the exercise by yourself.

## Usage

Just clone or download and then register for a free API key at https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api

Once you get your key, just add it to the `api.apiKey` value in the global state at the top.

**Note:** If you are using this as a production project, you should not store this in the client. You can create a proxy server and store your key there.
